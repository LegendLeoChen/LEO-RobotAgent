❓ Question: The drone is currently at (0, 0, 3)m with yaw 0° (positive x-axis). Please rotate the drone to explore the areas around its four sides and summarize what the camera sees.

---------------------------Turn 1--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I will begin by rotating the drone in 90° increments to face each of the four cardinal directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) while maintaining its current position at (0, 0, 3)m. At each orientation, I'll use the object detection tool to capture and analyze the scene ahead. This will allow me to summarize what is visible around all four sides of the drone.

🧰 Action: Calling tool uav_fly, Input: {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 3, 'yaw': 90}
🔥 Observation: True

---------------------------Turn 2--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have rotated the drone to face 90° (positive y-axis). Now I will capture an image to detect objects in this direction.

🧰 Action: Calling tool object_detection, Input: None
Detection time: 3.899456262588501
🔥 Observation: A person(0.704, 4.851, 0.674), a car(-4.653, 5.975, 0.818), a person(1.968, 4.793, 0.562), and a chair(3.115, 4.432, 0.26) are in the environment.

---------------------------Turn 3--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have captured the scene at 90° yaw and detected several objects: two people, a car, and a chair, all located roughly 4–6 meters ahead in the positive y-direction. Next, I will rotate the drone to 180° (facing negative x-axis) to survey the opposite side.

🧰 Action: Calling tool uav_fly, Input: {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 3, 'yaw': 180}
🔥 Observation: True

---------------------------Turn 4--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have rotated the drone to face 180° (negative x-axis). Now I will capture an image to detect objects in this direction.

🧰 Action: Calling tool object_detection, Input: None
Detection time: 4.061267614364624
🔥 Observation: A car(-7.514, 6.09, 0.217), a bookshelf(-5.28, -1.294, 0.246), a lamp(-5.235, 0.673, 0.051), and a bottle(-5.187, -1.443, 0.659) are in the environment. The ladder has no valid coordinates.

---------------------------Turn 5--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have captured the scene at 180° yaw and detected a car, a bookshelf, a lamp, and a bottle, mostly located around 5–7.5 meters ahead in the negative x-direction. The mention of a ladder lacks valid coordinates and is likely out of range. Next, I will rotate the drone to 270° (facing negative y-axis) to continue the survey.

🧰 Action: Calling tool uav_fly, Input: {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 3, 'yaw': 270}
🔥 Observation: True

---------------------------Turn 6--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have rotated the drone to face 270° (negative y-axis). Now I will capture an image to detect objects in this direction.

🧰 Action: Calling tool object_detection, Input: None
Detection time: 4.131082057952881
🔥 Observation: A desk(-1.158, -6.038, -0.222), a chair(1.036, -4.935, 0.228), a person(-1.985, -4.905, 0.622), a TV(-1.087, -5.034, 1.021), and a bottle(-0.469, -5.401, 0.778) are in the environment.

---------------------------Turn 7--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have captured the scene at 270° yaw and detected a desk, a chair, a person, a TV, and a bottle, all located approximately 5–6 meters ahead in the negative y-direction. Now I will rotate the drone back to 0° (positive x-axis) to complete the full 360° survey.

🧰 Action: Calling tool uav_fly, Input: {'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'z': 3, 'yaw': 0}
🔥 Observation: True

---------------------------Turn 8--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have rotated the drone back to 0° (positive x-axis) to complete the full 360° survey. Now I will capture an image to detect objects in this final direction and then provide a complete summary of all four sides.

🧰 Action: Calling tool object_detection, Input: None
Detection time: 2.18902325630188
🔥 Observation: A chair(5.577, -0.461, -0.093), a chair(5.582, 0.819, -0.084), and a desk(5.655, 0.244, 0.557).

---------------------------Turn 9--------------------------------

✅ Final Answer: I have now completed a full 360° survey of the environment around the drone at (0, 0, 3)m. Summary by direction:

- **0° (positive x-axis)**: Two chairs and a desk located ~5.6m ahead.
- **90° (positive y-axis)**: Two people, a car, and a chair ~4–6m ahead.
- **180° (negative x-axis)**: A car (~7.5m), bookshelf, lamp, and bottle (~5m); a ladder was mentioned but lacks valid coordinates.
- **270° (negative y-axis)**: A desk, chair, person, TV, and bottle ~5–6m ahead.

The surroundings are rich with indoor and outdoor objects, suggesting a mixed or cluttered environment near the drone.

✅ Time this run: 76.63s, Cumulative time: 76.63s
Token consumption: 10308
Motion path: [[0, 0, 3, 90], [0, 0, 3, 180], [0, 0, 3, 270], [0, 0, 3, 0]]

❓ Question: Fly above the TV.

---------------------------Turn 1--------------------------------
📧 Thought: I have identified the TV at coordinates (-1.087, -5.034, 1.021) from the 270° view. To fly above it, I will navigate the drone to a position directly above the TV with a safe altitude of at least 2m. I'll set the target position to (x=-1.087, y=-5.034, z=3.0) and yaw=0° for stability.

🧰 Action: Calling tool uav_fly, Input: {'x': -1.087, 'y': -5.034, 'z': 3.0, 'yaw': 0}
🔥 Observation: True

---------------------------Turn 2--------------------------------

✅ Final Answer: I have successfully flown the drone to a position directly above the TV at coordinates (-1.087, -5.034, 3.0) with yaw 0°. The drone is now hovering safely above the TV at an altitude of 3 meters, satisfying the minimum flight height requirement.
